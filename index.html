	    ## It's a challenging time

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## It's a challenging time
	  * increasing anthropogenic pressure on biosphere
	  * decreasing funding/anti-science
	  * complex scientific questions
	  <!--
	    It's a challenging time for biodiversity science. Here I'm using
	    "challenging" as in difficult time for biodiversity science. Human
	    pressure on the biosphere has never been so high. The climate is
	    changing faster than worse predictions, habitats are getting
	    destructed or fragmented by human activities. Everyday we are losing
	    species, we don't know exist or that we know nothing (or almost
	    nothing) about. Ecology and evolution in the 20th century have
	    strived to establish and formulate simple and general rules to
	    explain how species interact with each others and evolve, the 21st
	    century is showing that interactions are much more complex than we
	    thought and life is much more interconnect.  We know that humans are
	    mostly destroying the planet, while we are realizing that we
	    understand even less than we thought about the biosphere, and yet
	    scientists receive support from politicians and citizens to try to
	    solve these issues.

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## It's a challenging time
	  * collaboration faster and easier
	  * computing more powerful
	  * larger dataset easier to get
	  <!--
	    It's also a challenging time in the provocative sense: given these
	    difficulties, how can we solve this biodiversity puzzle? We have a
	    substantial ally in technology. We can now share data and ideas
	    faster and more easily than ever. We have access to computers that
	    can store humongous amount of data, and can do very complex
	    calculations in the blink of an eye. Faced with this biodiversity
	    puzzle, we need to take advantage of this technology to solve this
	    challenge.

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## It's a challenging time
	  * new skills needed
	  Scientists recognize they lack bioinformatics skills and want to learn them
	  ![](img/embl_poll.png)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## It's a challenging time
	  * new skills needed
	  * self-taught/"born with it"
	  * yet, can greatly accelerate research
	  <!--
	    But these opportunities come with their own set of challenges. They
	    require special skills that are not typically taught at the
	    undergrad or even the graduate level. Currently, most people go
	    throught the process of self-learning because of an "inate
	    predisposition" or as a side effect of another reason (hint:
	    advisor) it is slow, and imperfect. Yet, with better practices,
	    science could be greatly accelerated because people would spend less
	    time being busy doing things that could be automated, and have more
	    time for their science (and their families, students, etc.).

	<section>
	  ## Workshops
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	    ## What to learn?
	    1. How to collect data and record metadata?
	    1. How to obtain, format, combine large and heterogeneous data?
	    1. How to document analysis for reproducibility?
	    1. How and where to publish data and analysis alongside the manuscript?
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## Who should learn?
	  * Students
	  * Collection managers
	  * PIs
	  * IT staff
	  <!--
	    need change in culture. Better communication, manage expectations
	    of different groups, good data at each step of the way.
	  -->
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## Why learning these skills?
	  * Accelerate science
	  * More robust results
	  * Data management skills
	  * Data re-use (citations)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## Why learning these skills?
	  ![](img/automation.png)
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  ## Where to learn these skills?
	  * Field to Database
	  * Data Carpentry
	  * Data sharing, data standard, and demystifying the IPT
	  * Reproducible Science (upcoming)
	  * Managing Natural History Collections Data for Global Discoverability (upcoming)
	  <!--
	    these issues are not restricted to field of biodiversity science,
	    opportunity in other fields for cross disciplinary collaborations.
